Plans:
When I have the time, 
set up nested routes so I can pass data down from parents instead of makeing a new fetch call everytime.

Make a call to update the deck/cards but then edit the local data to make things seamless, 
and eliminate unnessecary fetch calls.

Also need to work on the edit Card and Deck files to make them better, they're sloppy right now.
